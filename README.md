# Robo-Waiter
I made an android app that controls the self-serving robot waiter. The system is implemented using multiple components. The Arduino Mega2560, an 8-bit microcontroller, is the robotâ€™s brain. Sonar sensor, L298N motor driver, ball caster, DC gear motors, 10-IR sensor array, Liquid Crystal Display, DC to DC buck converter, switch, wheels, buzzer, TCRT5000 IR sensor, and 3 cell lipo battery are among the other components.
[Demo of the project](https://youtu.be/fkcC4ygjQmU).
I have also published a paper on this robot and the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9977936) is published in IEEE.
